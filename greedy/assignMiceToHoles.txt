asked in Amazon



There are N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. 

Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse. 

A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.

Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.

Example:

positions of mice are:
4 -4 2
positions of holes are:
4 0 5

Assign mouse at position x=4 to hole at position x=4 : Time taken is 0 minutes 
Assign mouse at position x=-4 to hole at position x=0 : Time taken is 4 minutes 
Assign mouse at position x=2 to hole at position x=5 : Time taken is 3 minutes 
After 4 minutes all of the mice are in the holes.

Since, there is no combination possible where the last mouse's time is less than 4, 
answer = 4.
Input:

A :  list of positions of mice
B :  list of positions of holes
Output:

single integer value
NOTE: The final answer will fit in a 32 bit signed integer.


the best possible aproach would be to move the mice to the holes which are at nearest distance to them 
i.e the diffrernce between mouse position and the hole is minimum 

int Solution::mice(vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b) {
    int m=a.size();
    int n=b.size();
    int maxx=INT_MIN;
    sort(a.begin(),a.end());
    sort(b.begin(),b.end());
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        maxx=max(abs(a[i]-b[i]),maxx);
    }
return maxx;
}
