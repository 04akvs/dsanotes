Intuition

There's no cost to move numbers by a difference of 2.
 Hence, we can move all even numbers to 0 and all odd numbers to 1 without any cost. 
 Now, finally, we need to bring all numbers to zero or 1.
  Hence, we find out whether moving the odd numbers or the even numbers would incur a greater cost.
   We return the minimum of the two

public:
    int minCostToMoveChips(vector<int>& position) {
        int even=0;int odd=0;
        for(int i=0;i<position.size();i++)
        {
         if(position[i]%2==0)
            even++;
            else
            odd++;
        }
        return min(odd,even);
    }
};
