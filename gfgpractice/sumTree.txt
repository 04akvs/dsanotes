Given a Binary Tree. Check whether it is a Sum Tree or not.

A Binary Tree is a Sum Tree in which value of each node x is equal to sum of nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree . An empty tree is also a Sum Tree as sum of an empty tree can be considered to be 0. A leaf node is also considered as a Sum Tree.

Example 1:

Input:
    3
  /   \    
 1     2

Output: 1
Explanation: The given tree is a sum 
tree so return a boolean true.



int sum(Node* root)
{
    if(root==NULL)
    return 0;
    else
    return root->data+sum(root->left)+sum(root->right);
}
bool isSum(Node* root)
{
    if(root==NULL || (root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL))
    return true;
    int leftt=sum(root->left);
    int rightt=sum(root->right);
    if(leftt+rightt==root->data && isSum(root->left) && isSum(root->right))
    return true;
    else
    return false;
}
bool isSumTree(Node* root)
{
     // Your code here
     return isSum(root);
     
}
