remove half nodes asked in Amazon:


Problem Description

Given a binary tree A with N nodes.

You have to remove all the half nodes and return the final binary tree.

NOTE:

Half nodes are nodes which have only one child.
Leaves should not be touched as they have both children as NULL.


Problem Constraints
 1 <= N <= 105



Input Format
First and only argument is an pointer to the root of binary tree A.



Output Format
Return a pointer to the root of the new binary tree.



Example Input
Input 1:

           1
         /   \
        2     3
       / 
      4

Input 2:

            1
          /   \
         2     3
        / \     \
       4   5     6


Example Output
Output 1:

           1
         /   \
        4     3
Output 2:

            1
          /   \
         2     6
        / \

       4   5



Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The only half node present in the tree is 2 so we will remove this node.
Explanation 2:

 The only half node present in the tree is 3 so we will remove this node.



we'll do a postorder traversal of tree and try building the tree from the bottom :
We first process the left children, then right children, and finally the node itself. 
So we form the new tree bottom up, starting from the leaves towards the root

By the time we process the current node, both its left and right subtrees were already processed.

Time complexity of the below  solution is O(N) as it does a simple traversal of binary tree.


TreeNode* removehalf(TreeNode* root){
     if(root==NULL)
     return root;
     root->left=removehalf(root->left);
     root->right=removehalf(root->right);
     if(root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL)//leaf node 
     return root;
     if(root->left==NULL){//if left is NULL means one child 
      TreeNode* temp=root->right;
      free(root);
      return temp;
     }
     if(root->right==NULL){
         TreeNode* temp=root->left;
         free(root);
       return temp;
     }
     return root;

 }
TreeNode* Solution::solve(TreeNode* root) {
if(root==NULL) return root;
return removehalf(root);

}
