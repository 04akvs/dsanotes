Given a positive integer N, return its corresponding column title as it would appear in an Excel sheet.
For N =1 we have column A, for 27 we have AA and so on.

Note: The alphabets are all in uppercase.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 51
Output: AY
N=705
Output:AAC

Your Task:
Complete the function ExcelColumn() which takes N as input and returns output string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log(N))

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 107


string ExcelColumn(int N)
    {
        // Your code goes here
        
          string str="";string r="";
            int quo=N;
          while(quo){
            if(quo%26==0)//if remainder is zero then its 'Z'
            {
                str='Z'+str;
                quo=quo-1;
            }
            else
            {
                str=char((quo%26-1)+'A')+str;
            }
            quo=(quo/26);//as 'A' begins from 0
        }
        return str;
        
    }
