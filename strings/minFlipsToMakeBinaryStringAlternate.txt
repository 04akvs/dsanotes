Given a binary string, that is it contains only 0s and 1s. We need to make this string a sequence of alternate characters by flipping some of the bits, our goal is to minimize the number of bits to be flipped.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "001"
Output: 1
Explanation: We can flip the 0th bit to 1
to have "101".
â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
S = "0001010111"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can flip the 1st and 8th bit
to have "0101010101".

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minFlips() which takes the string S as input and returns the minimum number of flips required.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105
