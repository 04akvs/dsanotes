Given a sentence in the form of a string in uppercase, convert it into its equivalent mobile numeric keypad sequence.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "GFG"
Output: 43334
Explanation: For 'G' press '4' one time.
For 'F' press '3' three times.
Example 2:

Input:
S = "HEY U"
Output: 4433999088
Explanation: For 'H' press '4' two times.
â€‹For 'E' press '3' two times. For 'Y' press '9' 
three times. For white space press '0' one time.
For 'U' press '8' two times.
 

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function printSequence() which takes a string as input parameter and returns its equivalent mobile numeric keypad sequence as a string.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(Length of String)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Length of String)
 

Constraints:

1 <= Length of String <= 105
Characters of string can be empty space or capital alphabets.




the idea is simple -
just map the characters to the way they'll appear when pressed on mobile keypad 
for eg : to get F , we need to press 3 three times thus it contributes to the string as '333'
to get H - '4' pressesd four times 


string printSequence(string s)
{
    //code here.
    string arr[]= {"2","22","222",
"3","33","333",
"4","44","444",
"5","55","555",
"6","66","666",
"7","77","777","7777",
"8","88","888",
"9","99","999","9999"};
string str="";
for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
    if(s[i]>='A' && s[i]<='Z')
    str+=arr[s[i]-'A'];
    else
    str+='0';
}
return str;

}

TC:O(n)
sc:O(n)
